I could not make the client work at all

I tried doing as the lab said with "ng add apollo-angular" but I got errors I do not know why.

I did manage to make the server work though. Please look at the files employee.graphqls AND EmployeesResolver for my implementation.
Give me all the partial marks I can get for completing those files thanks.
